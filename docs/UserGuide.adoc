= Introduction

NurseTraverse is designed for community nurses who make home visits to their patients. It is a laptop app that will allow nurses to keep track of their patients' data, appointments and visits. ComNurse is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

= Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `comnurse.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`patient list`* : lists all contacts
* **`patient add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.
* **`patient delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for detail of each command.

= Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by you e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Parameters are additional pieces of information required/used when running a command.
* Items in square brackets are *optional* e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items that are not in square brackets are required e.g. `n/NAME` from the `patient add` command.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
* Due to the number of commands, each command will follow the syntax of `*ENTITY ACTION [PARAMETERS]*`. For example, if you wanted to delete a patient, you would do something like `patient delete 3`.

=== Listing All Patients: `patient list`
You can see a list of all patients in the app by typing `patient list`.

In the list displayed, each patient will have an *index* number which can then be used for other features that require you to select a patient by *index* e.g. `patient delete`. Take note that a patient will be given the same *index* regardless of other display commands such as `patient find`.

Format: `patient list`

=== Finding Patient(s): `patient find`

You can find patients that fit the parameters given using `patient find`.

In the list displayed, each patient will have an *index* number which can then be used for other features that require you to select a patient by *index* e.g. `patient delete`. Take note that a patient will be given the same *index* regardless of other display commands such as `patient list` or if different parameters are used.


Format: `patient find [n/NAME] [p/PHONE_NUMBER] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [t/TAG]`

*Visits*

As a community nurse, you will often make home visitTodoItems to your patients. When you are visiting a patient, there is often a todo list that you will have to do as well as information that you will have to record. You can use the application to mark the items you have done in a visit and add further detail and notes about a visit (e.g. about a patient's symptoms). This section describes the features that will allow you to keep track of what you have to do during a visit and manage previous visitTodoItems.

*Todo Templates*

As a community nurse, you will often use a todo list to keep track of things that you have (and have not) done during a visit. It is tedious, however, to add multiple things to do / take note of for every patient; in fact, there may be many duplicated items.
