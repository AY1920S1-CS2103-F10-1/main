== PROJECT: NurseTraverse

---

== Overview

NurseTraverse is a desktop application meant for community nurse to help manage all the data that a community nurse might need. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to autocomplete any command words in application*
** What it does: +
-  Allows the user to easily complete a full command with or without typing. +
-  Guides user in selecting which command to enter next through commands classifications in suggestion panel and command explanations in result box +
** Justification: Nurses and new users may not be familiar with command line input and the different types commands in the application. Thus, having a suggestion panel at the side will greatly enhance user experience, especially for slow typers. Having a guided system will aid nurses in familiarising with the application commands and understanding of the different functions in the system in general.
** Highlights: The implementation of word suggestion is rather tedious since many of the full commands have different formats. For example, "pat-list" do not require any patient index and prefixes but "pat-edit 1 n/ ..." requires both. Thus the implementation of list handliers were changed a few times to fit the objective of providing a better user experience. Logic for checking already matched words in order to change a new set of suggestion words is challenging as well, mainly due to many commands having different formats as mentioned earlier.
** Credits: No outside code or ideas were referenced in the development of these features (beyond code that already exists within Address Book 3).
