== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to manage visits*
** What it does: allows the user to manage their visits to their patients. They can create their own "checklist" of things to do for each patient, record said data during a visit and view data from previous visits.
** Justification: This feature has been identified as a required feature by user stories https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103-F10-1/main/issues/5[#5], https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103-F10-1/main/issues/6[#6] and https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103-F10-1/main/issues/25[#25] and will provide significant value-add by allowing users to manage visit data directly.
** Highlights: --To add //This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
** Credits: No code or ideas were referenced to outside of this application (beyond code that already exists within _Address Book 3_).
