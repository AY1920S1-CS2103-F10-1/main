This set of functionality consists of one GUI component and two commands,
each of which rely on the same core components:

1. `HistoryPane` - GUI component that displays a numbered list of previous
data-modifying commands that can be reverted by `app-undo`.
2. `app-undo` - Command that reverts until a specified data-modifying command
in the history, or the previous data-modifying command if no argument is specified.
3. `app-redo` - Command that reverts the previous command if and only if it was an `app-undo`.

==== Implementation Overview

For undo/redo/history to function, there must be the following:

* A way to mark which `Command` s are data-modifying commands so that
non-data-modifying commands can be ignored.
* A mechanism to clearly demarcate the model state before and after the execution
of each data-modifying command.
* A way to record the state of the model before (or after) each command, together
with the `Command` object responsible.
* Methods to switch the state of the model back and forth from the states stored
in the history.

To achieve this, the following classes are introduced:

* `MutatorCommand` - An empty subclass of `Command` to indicate that a `Command` is a
data-modifying command and should be considered for undo/redo/history.
* `HistoryRecord` - Record of the command and data of one atomic commit in the command history. It consists of the
`MutatorCommand` responsible for the commit and the state of the model either before or after the commit. All recorded
states are deep copies decoupled from their original references.
* `HistoryManager` - Represents the history of the application. Maintains data structures containing `HistoryRecord` s
of each data state change.

Additionally, `LogicManager` and `Model` are modified to accommodate this functionality.

.Shallow Copy vs Deep copy
****
* Performing a __shallow copy__ of an object simply copies the values of the
references of each object the original object is pointing to. This results in the
copied object pointing to the same objects as the original. In the figure below,
`patientBook` and `copiedPatientBook` are separate `PatientBook` objects but actually
share the same `patient` object. Changes to `patient` through `PatientBook` would thus
affect `copiedPatientBook` as well.

* Performing a __deep copy__ creates duplicates of each object referenced by the original,
the objects referenced by those duplicates, and so on. These duplicates are completely
decoupled from their originals. In the figure below, `patient` is a different
object from `copiedPatient`, thus changes to `patient` would not affect `copiedPatient`.

==== Model

The following methods are added to the `Model` interface:

* `Model#commit(MutatorCommand)` - Commits the changes made to the address book since the last call to this method,
making them permanent and updating the UI data. The committing `MutatorCommand` is stored for history record purposes.
* `Model#getHistory()` - Returns an unmodifiable view of the history.
* `Model#undoTo(HistoryRecord)` - Reverts current model state to the that contained in the specified `HistoryRecord`
(i.e. the state before the command was executed).
* `Model#redo()` - Redoes the previous `MutatorCommand` if it was an undo.

==== Model Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How to record the PatientBook and AppointmentBook states in the history

* Alternative 1: Simply store references to `PatientBook` and `AppointmentBook`.
** Pros:
*** Easier to implement.
** Cons:
*** Relies on the assumption that the objects in `PatientBook` and `AddressBook`
are immutable; if they are not truly immutable, changes to the current model's
`PatientBook` and `AddressBook` state may leak and affect the states stored in
the history.

* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Defensively store deep copies of the `PatientBook` and `AppointmentBook`.

** Pros:
*** Prevents improperly coded `Patient` or `Appointment` (or their
associated classes) from breaking undo/redo/history functionality.
*** Can reuse JSON serialization code for persistent storage of `PatientBook` and `AppointmentBook`
to create deep copies by serializing then immediately deserializing them.

** Cons:
*** Consumes more memory and CPU time.
*** More difficult to implement - MVC pattern between UI view and models is broken in
two. This is because each time the current state is swapped with a state in the
history by `ModelManager`, the `ObservableList` viewed by the UI must also be
updated by the `ModelManager` instead of the `PatientBook` as the current
`PatientBook` is completely decoupled and placed into the history.

===== Aspect: Which class to place the HistoryManager in

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Make `HistoryManager` a field of `ModelManager`.

** Pros:
*** Ensures atomicity of the records in the history as pushing a transaction
to the `HistoryManager` can only be (and is always) done by `Model#commit()`
itself - records in the history are guaranteed to be products of complete command
execution rather than intermediate states.

** Cons:
*** More difficult to test `ModelManager` as two `ModelManager` objects may have
the same current state but differing `HistoryManager` objects.
*** May violate Single Responsibility Principle as `ModelManager` now has to manage
both its current state and its previous states.

* Alternative 2: Make `HistoryManager` a field of `LogicManager`.

** Pros:
*** Higher cohesion as `ModelManager` only represents the model's current state.
*** Easier to test `ModelManager` as only its current state matters.

** Cons:
*** It is possible for intermediate model states to be pushed to the `HistoryManager` -
trusts `LogicManager` to push the transaction to history after (and only
after) calling `Model#commit()`.
*** Requires `Command#execute()` to accept `HistoryManager` as a parameter just so
`UndoCommand` and `RedoCommand` can work even though the vast majority of commands do not require it.

==== Logic

In addition to `MutatorCommand` which was described earlier, the following logical classes are added:

1. `UndoCommand` - Undoes a designated command in the history, or the previous one if no argument is specified. The
`COMMAND_WORD` for this command is `app-undo`.
2. `UndoCommandParser` - Parses input arguments and creates a new UndoCommand object.
3. `RedoCommand` - Redoes the previous command if it was an undo. The `COMMAND_WORD` for this command is `app-redo`.

`HistoryManager` checks the classes of commands pushed to the history and does not record
them if they are instances of `UndoCommand` or `RedoCommand`. This ensures that successive `UndoCommand` s do
not undo themselves instead of the desired data-modifying commands, requiring `RedoCommand` for
the special case of undo reversion.

==== UI

The command history is constantly displayed in a panel on the right side of
the app. This `HistoryPanel` uses `HistoryRecordCard` s to display the
user-input text that invoked each command. It is a view of the `ObservableList<HistoryRecord>`
returned by `HistoryManager#asUnmodifiableObservableList()`.

==== UI Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Where to display the history

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Permanently display it in a dedicated panel.

** Pros:
*** User does not have to execute a 'history' command to view the history,
making it much easier to use the multiple undo function.

** Cons:
*** Takes up more space in the UI.

* Alternative 2: Display it as a tab in the `TabPane`.

** Pros:
*** Saves space in the UI.

** Cons:
*** User has to switch to the history tab to view it.
*** Less intuitive UX as the other tabs in the `TabPane` all display actual data
such as `Patient`, `Visit`, and `Appointment` info, whereas history is app metadata.

==== Use case
