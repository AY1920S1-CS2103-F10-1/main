Visit Management has 3 sections to it: the model that models the visits, the logic that allows users to manipulate these models and the UI.

==== Model

How Visits, VisitTodos and VisitTasks are stored can be seen in <<Design-Model>> above. To support the feature of ongoing visits and the constraint that there can only be 1 ongoing visit at a time, a `Pair<Integer, Integer>` named `pairOfOngoingPatAndVisitIndexes` is stored in `PatientBook`. This serves multiple purposes:

* To identify the `Patient` that is currently being visited and the `Visit` that is ongoing
* To ensure that the state is saved even if the application shuts down during an ongoing visit
* To ensure there is no duplication of data by storing only the indexes for reference
* Although there is a reference to the `Patient` in the `Visit` class, it is not stored in the JSON file. Thus, the `Patient` needs to be stored together with the `Visit` as a pair in `PatientBook`.

`Model` implements the following operations:

* `Model#setNewOngoingVisit(Visit visit)` -- Record a new ongoing `Visit` of person in the model. This `Visit` must be retrieved unmodified from a `Patient`, or an `IllegalArgumentException` will be thrown so only use this to begin visits.
* `Model#updateOngoingVisit(Visit updatedVisit)` -- Update an ongoing `Visit` in the model. This will update the ongoing `Visit` and update the `Visit` in the `Patient`. Use this to update an ongoing `Visit` when there is already a `Visit`.
* `Model#unsetOngoingVisit()` -- Set the ongoing visit of person in the model and address book to null (for cancelling or deleting visits).
* `Model#patientHasOngoingVisit(Person person)` -- Return true if the person has an ongoing visit.
* `Model#getObservableOngoingVisitList()` -- Returns a `ObservableList<Visit>` containing the ongoing `Visit` if there is an ongoing `Visit`.

==== Model Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How to reflect changes in ongoing visit on UI

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use an `ObservableList<Visit>` returned from `FXCollections.observableArrayList()`.
** Pros: Easier to implement.
** Cons: May not make logical sense as there will only be 0..1 ongoing `Visit` s at any point in time.

* **Alternative 2:** Manually trigger an update every time the ongoing `Visit` is updated.
** Pros: Makes logical sense as there will only be 0..1 ongoing `Visit` s at any point in time.
** Cons: Complex, increased coupling between UI and Model. These lead to an increase of work (and potentially errors) for the developer.

==== Logic

==== Logic Design Considerations

==== UI

A `Patient` 's `Visit` s, `VisitTodo` are displayed together with his details on `pat-list` and `pat-find` in a `TitledPane`.

An ongoing `Visit` is displayed in another tab named "Current Visit" using  `OngoingVisitListPanel` containing `OngoingVisitCard` which contains `VisitTaskTableView`. Likewise, in `pat-list` and `pat-find` use `FinishedVisitCard` s each containing a `VisitTaskTableView` to display the `Visit` s and `VisitTask` s.

==== UI Design Considerations

Aspect: How to display the `Patient` 's `Visit` records (and his `VisitTodo` s)

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Embed it with `pat-list` and `pat-find`.
** Pros: Easier to implement, convenient for user (don't have to call methods such as `visit-view` which will only show the visit)
** Cons: May clutter screen.

* **Alternative 2:** Implement functions such as `visit-view` etc.
** Pros: A cleaner result page from `pat-list` and `pat-find`.
** Cons: Increased developer work and user will have to use multiple commands to view the `Patient` 's `Visit` data.

Aspect: How to display the ongoing `Visit`

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Put the `PersonListPanel` into a `TabPane` and put the `OngoingVisitListPanel` in the same `TabPane`
** Pros: Neater.
** Cons: No real cons apart from the fact that the user will have to click to change tabs.

* **Alternative 2:** Open a new window to show the ongoing `Visit`.
** Pros: Can be viewed side by side with the main application.
** Cons: Increases clutter on user screen, increases complexity in handling scenario where user closes the window.

=== Use case

Visit Management is used when the user wants to visit a patient and record their visit.

The most complex part of this use case is in when the user decides to update the ongoing visit. The sequence of events is detailed in this link:images/VisitActivityDiagram.png{outfilesuffix}[sequence diagram]. Alternatively you can right click the image below and select "view image".
