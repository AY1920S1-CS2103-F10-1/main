<div class="paragraph">
<p>The appointments management feature is facilitated primarily by the <code>AppointmentBook</code>, a class that implements the <code>ReadOnlyAppointmentBook</code> interface and wraps around all appointments data of the app.
This is a new book (different from the <code>PatientBook</code>) that is now required by the <code>ModelManager</code> class for instantiation along with <code>UserPrefs</code> and <code>PatientBook</code>. The <code>AppointmentBook</code> is, therefore, a field in the <code>ModelManager</code> class.
The <code>AppointmentBook</code> has <code>appointments</code>, which is a <code>UniqueAppointmentList</code>, as a private field that holds all appointments currently in the <code>AppointmentBook</code> as a unique list. This list is modified from certain method calls in the <code>ModelManager</code> class.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="model"><a class="link" href="#model">Model</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The main operations in the <code>AppointmentBook</code> are exposed to in the <code>Model</code> interface. <code>Model</code> implements the following operations to accommodate for the inclusion of the <code>AppointmentBook</code> and its related methods:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>Model#setStagedAppointmentBook(ReadOnlyAppointmentBook appointmentBook)</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Replaces appointment book in the Model with data from the <code>ReadOnlyAppointmentBook appointmentBook</code> passed in as argument.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Model#replaceStagedAppointmentBook(List&lt;Appointment&gt; appointments)</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Replaces all appointments in appointment book with new appointments from the list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Model#getStagedAppointmentBook()</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Returns the current AppointmentBook.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Model#hasAppointment(Appointment appointment)</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Returns true if an appointment with the same identity as the appointment passed in as argument exists in the appointment list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Model#hasClashingAppointment(Appointment appointment)</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Returns true if any appointment in the appointment list has clashing time with the <code>appointment</code> passed in as argument.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Model#deleteAppointment(Appointment target)</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Deletes the given appointment. If the the <code>target</code> appointment is recurring, then the appointment is recurred and the next one is added to the appointment list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Model#deleteRecurringAppointment(Appointment target)</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Deletes the given recurring or non-recurring appointment permanently.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Model#deleteAppointments(Patient target, Index targetIndex)</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Deletes all appointments associated with the <code>target</code> patient.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Model#addAppointment(Appointment appointment)</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Adds the given appointment. The appointment passed in as argument must not already exist in the appointment list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Model#setAppointment(Appointment target, Appointment editedAppointment)</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Replaces the given appointment <code>target</code> with <code>editedAppointment</code>. <code>target</code> must exist in the appointment list. The appointment identity of <code>editedAppointment</code> must not be the same as another existing appointment in the appointment list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Model#setAppointments(Patient patientToEdit, Patient editedPatient)</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Replaces all appointments' patients that equal <code>patientToEdit</code> with <code>editedPatient</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Model#ObservableList&lt;Appointment&gt; getStagedAppointmentList()</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Returns an unmodifiable view of the entire appointment list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Model#FilteredList&lt;Appointment&gt; getFilteredAppointmentList()</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Returns an unmodifiable view of the filtered appointment list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Model#void updateFilteredAppointmentList(Predicate&lt;Appointment&gt; predicate)</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Updates the filter of the filtered appointment list to filter by the given <code>predicate</code>.</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 1 (current choice):</strong> Create <code>AppointmentBook</code> to wrap around all appointments and add it as a field of <code>ModelManager</code>.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Splitting the <code>AddressBook</code> into <code>PatientBook</code> and <code>AppointmentBook</code> clearly demarcates the handling of patients and appointments separately.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When there are changes made to the appointments, only the <code>AppointmentBook</code> is modified, i.e. there is no need to, for example, refresh the data for patients.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Overhead of more methods in the <code>Model</code> needed separately for the changes made in the <code>AppointmentBook</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Major refactoring was needed in many classes and tests since there were changes to the constructor and fields of the <code>ModelManager</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 2:</strong> Modify the original <code>AddressBook</code> to have two unique lists as fields within it, one for patients and one for appointments.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The number of extra methods added to the <code>Model</code> could have been reduced since some methods may do the same operation on both appointment and patient lists.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Principle of separation of concerns may be violated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optimization might be compromised, since methods intended to operate only on the specific patient or appointment lists might operate on the whole <code>AddressBook</code> unnecessarily.</p>

<p>The following logical <code>Parser</code> classes to parse user commands' arguments, and the corresponding <code>Command</code> classes they returned were implemented:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p><code>FindAppointmentParser</code> returns <code>FindAppointmentCommand</code> - Finds and lists all appointments in appointment book whose name contains any of the argument keywords.<br>
The <code>COMMAND_WORD</code> for this command is <code>appt-find</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>AddAppointmentParser</code> returns <code>AddAppointmentCommand</code> - Adds an appointment to the appointment list.<br>
The <code>COMMAND_WORD</code> is <code>appt-add</code>.</p>

<li>
<p><code>EditAppointmentParser</code> returns <code>EditAppointmentCommand</code> - Edits the details of an existing appointment in the appointment book.<br>
The <code>COMMAND_WORD</code> is <code>appt-edit</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>DeleteAppointmentParser</code> returns <code>DeleteAppointmentCommand</code> - Deletes an appointment identified using it&#8217;s displayed index from the appointment book.
For recurring appointments, the recurring appointment is deleted and the next recurred one is added to the appointment list.<br>
The <code>COMMAND_WORD</code> is <code>appt-delete</code>.</p>

<li>
<p><code>ListAppointmentCommand</code> - Lists all appointments in the appointment book.

<p><strong>Alternative 1 (current choice):</strong> Create <code>DeleteAppointmentPermanentlyParser</code> and <code>DeleteAppointmentPermanentlyCommand</code> as new classes independent of the <code>DeleteAppointmentParser</code> and <code>DeleteAppointmentCommand</code> classes.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>A simple solution that clearly separates cases of when an appointment is deleted permanently from the list versus when the appointment is deleted and the recurred next appointment is added to the list.</p>

</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Does not really separate the cases of recurring appointments from non-recurring ones since <code>appt-delete-permanent</code> can be applied on both recurring and non-recurring appointments.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 2:</strong> Create <code>DeleteAppointmentPermanentlyParser</code> and <code>DeleteAppointmentPermanentlyCommand</code> as new classes that now extend from the <code>DeleteAppointmentParser</code> and <code>DeleteAppointmentCommand</code> classes.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>By extending, code reusability is increased.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It also makes sense in terms of class structure for such an extension, since deleting an appointment permanently is a more specific case of deleting an appointment and also allowing to recur it and then add it back (if it was a recurring appointment).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>This still does not resolve the issue of separation deletion of recurring appointments from non-recurring ones.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Despite extending, there may not be too much code overlap. Also, considering that new methods will have to be added to the <code>Model</code> for each case of permanent and non-permanent deletion, the extension might well prove to be unecessary.</p>

</ul>

</li>
</ul>

<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 3:</strong> Create <code>DeleteRecurringAppointmentParser</code> and <code>DeleteRecurringAppointmentCommand</code> as new classes independent from the <code>DeleteAppointmentParser</code> and <code>DeleteAppointmentCommand</code> classes.<br>
But <code>DeleteRecurringAppointmentCommand</code> can only be applied to appointments that are recurring.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Demarcates recurring and non-recurring appointments deletion better since the user will now have only one way to delete non-recurring appointments, i.e. through <code>appt-delete</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Can be a bit restrictive since one command is reserved for only recurring appointments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The names of these classes can be a bit misleading since <code>appt-delete</code> can still be applied on both recurring and non-recurring appointments.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most complex workflow is when a user deletes a recurring appointment.
In doing so, as indicated in the Use Case diagram above, the appointment is first deleted from the list of appointments.
The appointment is then recurred to get the next appointment (i.e. with the next start and end date time), and added to the list of appointments by directly calling the <code>AppointmentBook#addRecurringAppointment</code> method.
Assuming the first appointment in the appointment list is recurring. The following sequence diagrams show the object interactions for user command <code>appt-delete 1</code>:</p>
