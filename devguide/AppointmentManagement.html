<div class="paragraph">
<p>The appointments management feature is facilitated primarily by the <code>AppointmentBook</code>, a class that implements the <code>ReadOnlyAppointmentBook</code> interface and wraps around all appointments data of the app.
This is a new book (different from the <code>PatientBook</code>) that is now required by the <code>ModelManager</code> class for instantiation along with <code>UserPrefs</code> and <code>PatientBook</code>. The <code>AppointmentBook</code> is, therefore, a field in the <code>ModelManager</code> class.
The <code>AppointmentBook</code> has <code>appointments</code>, which is a <code>UniqueAppointmentList</code>, as a private field that holds all appointments currently in the <code>AppointmentBook</code> as a unique list. This list is modified from certain method calls in the <code>ModelManager</code> class.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The operations of the <code>ReadOnlyAppointmentBook</code> interface that the <code>AppointmentBook</code> implements:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>AppointmentBook#getAppointmentList()</code> - Returns an unmodifiable view of the appointments list in the <code>AppointmentBook</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>AppointmentBook#deepCopy()</code> - Returns a deep copy of the <code>AppointmentBook</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Apart from the above, the other main operations (both public and private methods) that the <code>AppointmentBook</code> implements include:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>AppointmentBook#setAppointments(List&lt;Appointment&gt; appointments)</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Replaces the contents of the private <code>appointments</code> field with <code>appointments</code> passed in as argument.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>AppointmentBook#setFinishedAppointments(List&lt;Appointment&gt; appointments)</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Replaces the contents of the private <code>finishedAppointments</code> field with <code>appointments</code> passed in as argument (layout for a possible feature <a href="#Displaying Finished Appointments">[Displaying Finished Appointments]</a> in V2.0).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>AppointmentBook#resetData(ReadOnlyAppointmentBook newData)</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Resets the existing data of the <code>AppointmentBook</code> with <code>newData</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>AppointmentBook#hasAppointment(Appointment appointment)</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Returns true if an appointment with the same identity as the <code>appointment</code> argument exists in the <code>AppointmentBook</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>AppointmentBook#hasClashingAppointment(Appointment appointment)</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Returns true if an appointment with clashing time as the <code>appointment</code> argument exists in the <code>AppointmentBook</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>AppointmentBook#addAppointment(Appointment a)</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Adds an appointment <code>a</code> to the <code>AppointmentBook</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>AppointmentBook#setAppointment(Appointment target, Appointment editedAppointment)</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Replaces the given appointment <code>target</code> in the list of the <code>AppointmentBook</code> with the <code>editedAppointment</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>AppointmentBook#editAppointments(Patient patientToEdit, Patient editedPatient)</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Replaces all appointments with the <code>patientToEdit</code> in the list with <code>editedPatient</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>AppointmentBook#removeAppointment(Appointment key)</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Removes <code>key</code> from the <code>AppointmentBook</code>.<br>
<strong>Note: If appointment <code>key</code> is recurring, the appointment is recurred to get the next start and end date times of this appointment, and this next appointment is added to the the <code>AppointmentBook</code>.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>AppointmentBook#removeRecurringAppointment(Appointment key)</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Removes <code>key</code> from the <code>AppointmentBook</code> permanently. <strong>Does not</strong> recur the appointment <code>key</code>.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><code>AppointmentBook#addRecurringAppointment(Appointment key)</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Adds same appointment <code>key</code> with the next date time if previous one was deleted and was recurring.</p>

<p><strong>Alternative 1 (current choice):</strong> Create <code>AppointmentBook</code> to wrap around all appointments and add it as a field of <code>ModelManager</code>.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Splitting the <code>AddressBook</code> into <code>PatientBook</code> and <code>AppointmentBook</code> clearly demarcates the handling of patients and appointments separately.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When there are changes made to the appointments, only the <code>AppointmentBook</code> is modified, i.e. there is no need to, for example, refresh the data for patients.</p>

</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Overhead of more methods in the <code>Model</code> needed separately for the changes made in the <code>AppointmentBook</code>.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 2:</strong> Modify the original <code>AddressBook</code> to have two unique lists as fields within it, one for patients and one for appointments.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The number of extra methods added to the <code>Model</code> could have been reduced since some methods may do the same operation on both appointment and patient lists.</p>

<p>Cons:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>

<p>A simple solution that clearly separates cases of when an appointment is deleted permanently from the list versus when the appointment is deleted and the recurred next appointment is added to the list.</p>

</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons:</p>

<p>Does not really separate the cases of recurring appointments from non-recurring ones since <code>appt-delete-permanent</code> can be applied on both recurring and non-recurring appointments.</p>

<p><strong>Alternative 2:</strong> Create <code>DeleteAppointmentPermanentlyParser</code> and <code>DeleteAppointmentPermanentlyCommand</code> as new classes that now extend from the <code>DeleteAppointmentParser</code> and <code>DeleteAppointmentCommand</code> classes.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>By extending, code reusability is increased.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It also makes sense in terms of class structure for such an extension, since deleting an appointment permanently is a more specific case of deleting an appointment and also allowing to recur it and then add it back (if it was a recurring appointment).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>This still does not resolve the issue of separation deletion of recurring appointments from non-recurring ones.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Despite extending, there may not be too much code overlap. Also, considering that new methods will have to be added to the <code>Model</code> for each case of permanent and non-permanent deletion, the extension might well prove to be unecessary.</p>

But <code>DeleteRecurringAppointmentCommand</code> can only be applied to appointments that are recurring.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Demarcates recurring and non-recurring appointments deletion better since the user will now have only one way to delete non-recurring appointments, i.e. through <code>appt-delete</code>.</p>

<p>Cons:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>

<p>Can be a bit restrictive since one command is reserved for only recurring appointments.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most complex workflow is when a user deletes a recurring appointment.
In doing so, as indicated in the Use Case diagram above, the appointment is first deleted from the list of appointments.
The appointment is then recurred to get the next appointment (i.e. with the next start and end date time), and added to the list of appointments by directly calling the <code>AppointmentBook#addRecurringAppointment</code> method.
Assuming the first appointment in the appointment list is recurring. The following sequence diagrams show the object interactions for user command <code>appt-delete 1</code>:</p>
