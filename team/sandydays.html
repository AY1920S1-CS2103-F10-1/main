<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>NurseTraverse is a desktop application designed to help community nurses manage all the data they may need, including visit management, appointment scheduling, and importing and exporting of patient data.
The user interacts with the app using a CLI (Command Line Interface) enhanced with an autocomplete functionality and ability to undo and redo commands. The app has a GUI created with JavaFX and is written in Java.
NurseTraverse is built by me and 4 other students.</p>

<p>Lists all appointments nurses have scheduled, including reference to patient details, appointment start and end date and time, frequency with which the appointment recurs (if it does), and additional description details associated with the appointment.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Major enhancement</strong>: added <strong>the ability to manage appointments</strong></p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What it does: allows the user to schedule and manage appointments with their patients. The user can add, edit, delete their appointments, Preceding undo commands can be reversed by using the redo command.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because tracking the appointments associated with different patients is a must-have for every community nurse so that they can organize their schedule before paying visits to the patients.<br>
This feature has been identified as a required feature in user story <a href="https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103-F10-1/main/issues/7">#7</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>This enhancement adds a new feature to the app. Lot of groundwork to be done in terms of setting up the <code>AppointmentBook</code>, converting <code>AppointmentBook</code> data to <code>JSON</code> for storage, adding it to be tracked by the <code>ModelManager</code> when the app is running, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The feature adds new commands for listing appointments scheduled, finding specific appointments by patient name, adding, deleting, and editing appointments, where the appointments can be recurring or non-recurring. It affects any appointment-related commands to be added in the future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Particularly challenging was implementing recurring appointments and prevention of clashing appointments alongside each other, since appointments that are added may clash with future date and time of a recurring appointment. Many design alternatives had to be considered before it was decided to recur appointments until they did not clash with any appointments in the existing list of appointments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moreover, since this feature takes into account the association from the <code>Appointments</code> to the <code>Patient</code> class, it affected existing patient commands' behaviour (for instance, deleting or editing of patients accordingly result in deleting and editing the appointments associated with this patient).<br>
Handling and implementing this association while trying to minimise the coupling as much as possible was challenging and required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives.</p>

</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Minor enhancements</strong>:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Added appointment card and appointment list in a separate tab for easy user visibility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improved date time printing such that the date times are viewed as, for example, <code>Sun, 1st Dec 2019, 18:00</code> instead of <code>01-12-2019 1800</code>.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The appointments management feature is facilitated primarily by the <code>AppointmentBook</code>, a class that implements the <code>ReadOnlyAppointmentBook</code> interface and wraps around all appointments data of the app.
This is a new book (different from the <code>PatientBook</code>) that is now required by the <code>ModelManager</code> class for instantiation along with <code>UserPrefs</code> and <code>PatientBook</code>. The <code>AppointmentBook</code> is, therefore, a field in the <code>ModelManager</code> class.
The <code>AppointmentBook</code> has <code>appointments</code>, which is a <code>UniqueAppointmentList</code>, as a private field that holds all appointments currently in the <code>AppointmentBook</code> as a unique list. This list is modified from certain method calls in the <code>ModelManager</code> class.</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 1 (current choice):</strong> Create <code>AppointmentBook</code> to wrap around all appointments and add it as a field of <code>ModelManager</code>.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Splitting the <code>AddressBook</code> into <code>PatientBook</code> and <code>AppointmentBook</code> clearly demarcates the handling of patients and appointments separately.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When there are changes made to the appointments, only the <code>AppointmentBook</code> is modified, i.e. there is no need to, for example, refresh the data for patients.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Overhead of more methods in the <code>Model</code> needed separately for the changes made in the <code>AppointmentBook</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Major refactoring was needed in many classes and tests since there were changes to the constructor and fields of the <code>ModelManager</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 2:</strong> Modify the original <code>AddressBook</code> to have two unique lists as fields within it, one for patients and one for appointments.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The number of extra methods added to the <code>Model</code> could have been reduced since some methods may do the same operation on both appointment and patient lists.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Principle of separation of concerns may be violated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optimization might be compromised, since methods intended to operate only on the specific patient or appointment lists might operate on the whole <code>AddressBook</code> unnecessarily.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Appointment Management is used when the user wants to schedule an appointment with the patient. There are 6 actions that a user can perform:</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Perhaps the most complex workflow is when a user deletes a recurring appointment.
In doing so, as indicated in the Use Case diagram above, the appointment is first deleted from the list of appointments.
The appointment is then recurred to get the next appointment (i.e. with the next start and end date time), and added to the list of appointments by directly calling the <code>AppointmentBook#addRecurringAppointment</code> method.
Assuming the first appointment in the appointment list is recurring. The following sequence diagrams show the object interactions for user command <code>appt-delete 1</code>:</p>
