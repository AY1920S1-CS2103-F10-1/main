<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>NurseTraverse is a desktop application designed to help community nurses manage all the data they may need, including visit management, appointment scheduling, and importing and exporting of patient data.
The user interacts with the app using a CLI (Command Line Interface) enhanced with an autocomplete functionality and ability to undo and redo commands. The app has a GUI created with JavaFX and is written in Java.
NurseTraverse is built by me and 4 other students.</p>

<p>Lists all appointments nurses have scheduled, including reference to patient details, appointment start and end date and time, frequency with which the appointment recurs (if it does), and additional description details associated with the appointment.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Major enhancement</strong>: added <strong>the ability to manage appointments</strong></p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What it does: allows the user to schedule and manage appointments with their patients. The user can add, edit, delete their appointments, Preceding undo commands can be reversed by using the redo command.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because tracking the appointments associated with different patients is a must-have for every community nurse so that they can organize their schedule before paying visits to the patients.<br>
This feature has been identified as a required feature in user story <a href="https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103-F10-1/main/issues/7">#7</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>This enhancement adds a new feature to the app. Lot of groundwork to be done in terms of setting up the <code>AppointmentBook</code>, converting <code>AppointmentBook</code> data to <code>JSON</code> for storage, adding it to be tracked by the <code>ModelManager</code> when the app is running, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The feature adds new commands for listing appointments scheduled, finding specific appointments by patient name, adding, deleting, and editing appointments, where the appointments can be recurring or non-recurring. It affects any appointment-related commands to be added in the future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Particularly challenging was implementing recurring appointments and prevention of clashing appointments alongside each other, since appointments that are added may clash with future date and time of a recurring appointment. Many design alternatives had to be considered before it was decided to recur appointments until they did not clash with any appointments in the existing list of appointments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moreover, since this feature takes into account the association from the <code>Appointments</code> to the <code>Patient</code> class, it affected existing patient commands' behaviour (for instance, deleting or editing of patients accordingly result in deleting and editing the appointments associated with this patient).<br>
Handling and implementing this association while trying to minimise the coupling as much as possible was challenging and required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives.</p>

</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Minor enhancements</strong>:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Added appointment card and appointment list in a separate tab for easy user visibility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improved date time printing such that the date times are viewed as, for example, <code>Sun, 1st Dec 2019, 18:00</code> instead of <code>01-12-2019 1800</code>.</p>

<p>As of version 1.4, the appointments feature <strong>does not allow for user&#8217;s discretion on managing clashing appointments. Instead, it simply prevents a user from adding a clashing appointment.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When an appointment is added or edited, while there is a check to ensure the appointment does not clash with any other existing appointment in the list, there is <strong>no check done on whether this new appointment could potentially clash with any future appointments</strong> that could result from an appointment recurring.<br>
In such cases, if an appointment that is a added or edited clashes with a future date time of a recurring appointment, the app allows adding such an appointment.<br>
But when the recurring appointment that our new appointment clashes with is recurred (due to <code>appt-delete</code> of the recurring appointment or the recurring appointment passing the system date time), then the <strong>recurring appointment is recurred (keep getting the next start and end date time) until it doesn&#8217;t clash with any of the existing appointments in the appointment list.</strong><br>
Allowing user discretion for clashing appointments (i.e. simply flagging the clashing appointments) is a feature coming in <code>V2.0</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If changes are made to the <code>appointmentBook.json</code> file directly (i.e. not through the app) such that there are clashing appointments, the app won&#8217;t detect these clashes and will <strong>load the appointment book as it is with these clashing appointments. This can result in unexpected behaviour of the app as it is not thoroughly designed to work with clashing appointments in the appointment list.</strong><br>
So, please refrain from making direct edits such that there result clashing appointments in the <code>appointmentBook.json</code> file.<br>
Detecting these clashes from storage and if detected, loading an empty appointment list instead is a feature coming in <code>V2.0</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While the system doesn&#8217;t allow appointments with end date and times before the system&#8217;s date and time, and recurs appointments (that are recurring) until they are past the system date and time, this happens only when the app is opened.<br>
<strong>While the app is running, there is no constant checking of whether the appointments in the list have already finished (i.e. if their end date time is before the system date time).</strong></p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The appointments management feature is facilitated primarily by the <code>AppointmentBook</code>, a class that implements the <code>ReadOnlyAppointmentBook</code> interface and wraps around all appointments data of the app.
This is a new book (different from the <code>PatientBook</code>) that is now required by the <code>ModelManager</code> class for instantiation along with <code>UserPrefs</code> and <code>PatientBook</code>. The <code>AppointmentBook</code> is, therefore, a field in the <code>ModelManager</code> class.
The <code>AppointmentBook</code> has <code>appointments</code>, which is a <code>UniqueAppointmentList</code>, as a private field that holds all appointments currently in the <code>AppointmentBook</code> as a unique list. This list is modified from certain method calls in the <code>ModelManager</code> class.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The operations of the <code>ReadOnlyAppointmentBook</code> interface that the <code>AppointmentBook</code> implements:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>AppointmentBook#getAppointmentList()</code> - Returns an unmodifiable view of the appointments list in the <code>AppointmentBook</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>AppointmentBook#deepCopy()</code> - Returns a deep copy of the <code>AppointmentBook</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Apart from the above, the other main operations (both public and private methods) that the <code>AppointmentBook</code> implements include:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>AppointmentBook#setAppointments(List&lt;Appointment&gt; appointments)</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Replaces the contents of the private <code>appointments</code> field with <code>appointments</code> passed in as argument.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>AppointmentBook#setFinishedAppointments(List&lt;Appointment&gt; appointments)</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Replaces the contents of the private <code>finishedAppointments</code> field with <code>appointments</code> passed in as argument (layout for a possible feature <a href="#Displaying Finished Appointments">[Displaying Finished Appointments]</a> in V2.0).</p>
</li>
<li>

<li>
<p><code>AppointmentBook#removeAppointment(Appointment key)</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Removes <code>key</code> from the <code>AppointmentBook</code>.<br>
<strong>Note: If appointment <code>key</code> is recurring, the appointment is recurred to get the next start and end date times of this appointment, and this next appointment is added to the the <code>AppointmentBook</code>.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>AppointmentBook#removeRecurringAppointment(Appointment key)</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Removes <code>key</code> from the <code>AppointmentBook</code> permanently. <strong>Does not</strong> recur the appointment <code>key</code>.</p>

<ul>

<p>By extending, code reusability is increased.</p>

<p>It also makes sense in terms of class structure for such an extension, since deleting an appointment permanently is a more specific case of deleting an appointment and also allowing to recur it and then add it back (if it was a recurring appointment).</p>

<p>Might need to handle the reading and saving of the finished appointments differently from the main appointment list.</p>
</li>
<li>

Assuming the first appointment in the appointment list is recurring. The following sequence diagrams show the object interactions for user command <code>appt-delete 1</code>:</p>
