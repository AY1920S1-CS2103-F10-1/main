<p>As a community nurse, you will often schedule appointments with your patients before visiting them, as well as keep track of these appointments you make with your patients.

<p>As of version 1.4, the appointments feature <strong>does not allow for user&#8217;s discretion on managing clashing appointments. Instead, it simply prevents a user from adding a clashing appointment.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When an appointment is added or edited, while there is a check to ensure the appointment does not clash with any other existing appointment in the list, there is <strong>no check done on whether this new appointment could potentially clash with any future appointments</strong> that could result from an appointment recurring.<br>
In such cases, if an appointment that is a added or edited clashes with a future date time of a recurring appointment, the app allows adding such an appointment.<br>
But when the recurring appointment that our new appointment clashes with is recurred (due to <code>appt-delete</code> of the recurring appointment or the recurring appointment passing the system date time), then the <strong>recurring appointment is recurred (keep getting the next start and end date time) until it doesn&#8217;t clash with any of the existing appointments in the appointment list.</strong><br>
Allowing user discretion for clashing appointments (i.e. simply flagging the clashing appointments) is a feature coming in <code>V2.0</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If changes are made to the <code>appointmentBook.json</code> file directly (i.e. not through the app) such that there are clashing appointments, the app won&#8217;t detect these clashes and will <strong>load the appointment book as it is with these clashing appointments. This can result in unexpected behaviour of the app as it is not thoroughly designed to work with clashing appointments in the appointment list.</strong><br>
So, please refrain from making direct edits such that there result clashing appointments in the <code>appointmentBook.json</code> file.<br>
Detecting these clashes from storage and if detected, loading an empty appointment list instead is a feature coming in <code>V2.0</code>.</p>

<p>While the system doesn&#8217;t allow appointments with end date and times before the system&#8217;s date and time, and recurs appointments (that are recurring) until they are past the system date and time, this happens only when the app is opened.<br>
<strong>While the app is running, there is no constant checking of whether the appointments in the list have already finished (i.e. if their end date time is before the system date time).</strong></p>
